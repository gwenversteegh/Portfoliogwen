            <h3> Avocado media </h3>
            <p>I did my graduation internship at Avocado media, now known as Clarity. One of their problems was that they grew fast and really needed
                new people added to their team. To achieve this, they needed a career page on their own website. To find out what people want to see on a career
                page and what makes them apply for jobs, I did a little research project and implemented this on the page. I used their brand style in combination with my own creativity
                to make it easy accessible and make it a whole with the rest of the site.

            <h3> KPMG Sofy Suite </h3>
            <p> KPMG Sofy Suite was quite a difficult site to navigate and to find what you're looking for. To make this easier I made a re-design 
                from the original website. This was quite a challenge because there was a lot of information that needed to be shown.

            <h3> WeSmyle </h3>
            <p> In my second year at school I did my internship at WeSmyle. I got here the change to learn more about visual design and how important
                 this is for the company. I mainly did visual design for social media, advertising and I worked on the new website
                 with Shopify. Because it was a start up company, I got a lot of freedom to do my own thing and to work indepent on projects.

                <p>Hi! I'm Gwen Versteegh. I recently completed my studies in Communication and Multimedia Design, 
                    specializing in UX and UI design. I did a minor in frontend design & development but my passion lies in creating intuitive and engaging user experiences that matter to diverse audiences. 
                    Alongside my professional interests, I have a deep love for working with children, which adds a rewarding dimension 
                    to my life. In my free time, I give surf lessons to children with a mental disorder. I enjoy surfing,photography, pole dancing, or diving into a good book. 
                    These hobbies keep me active and inspired, and I always enjoy trying new things.</p>
